NeoFS REST Gateway bridges NeoFS internal protocol and REST API server.

### Open API specification

See full [API spec](/v1/docs).

### Basic concept

Using this API you can interact with NeoFS nodes and manage containers and objects.

#### Container

To create container you must provide `PlacementPolicy` and `BasicACL`.

##### Placement policy

Placement policy allows you control where and how container (and its object) is stored.
For example, you want to store 3 copy of every object, so you can use the following policy:

```
REP 3
```

[More about policy](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-spec/blob/7ae698ebbe68c689cab2aba518312e7d3eea403c/01-arch/02-policy.md).

##### Basic ACL

Basic ACL is a part of the container structure, and it is always created simultaneously with the container.
Therefore, it is never subject to any changes. It is a 32-bit integer with a bit field in the following format:

| Symbol | Meaning | Description                                                                                    |
|--------|:--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B**  | Bearer  | Allows using Bear Token ACL rules to replace eACL rules                                        |
| **U**  | User    | The owner of the container identified by the public key linked to the container                |
| **S**  | System  | Inner Ring and/or container nodes in the current version of network map                        |
|        |         | IR nodes can only perform `GetRangeHash`, `Head`, and `Search` necessary for data audit.       |
|        |         | Container nodes can only do things required for the replication.                               |
| **O**  | Others  | Clients that do not match any of the categories above                                          |
| **F**  | Final   | Flag denying Extended ACL. If set, Basic ACL check is final, Extended ACL is ignored           |
| **X**  | Sticky  | Flag denying different owners of the request and the object                                    |
|        |         | If set, object in `Put` request must have one `Owner` and be signed with the same signature    |
|        |         | If not set, the object must be correct but can be of any owner.                                |
|        |         | The nodes falling for `SYSTEM` role are exception from this rule. For them the bit is ignored. |
| **0**  | Deny    | Denies operation of the identified category                                                    |
| **1**  | Allow   | Allows operation of the identified category                                                    |

To upload objects with bearer token your container must have Bearer bits set. 
For example, you can use `0x0FBFBFFF` or predefined `eacl-public-read-write` values. 

Also don't forget set appropriate eACL to restrict your container.

[More about ACL](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-spec/blob/4f8d945dfbd2a313ebd406746cf38b9de9da6038/01-arch/07-acl.md).

#### Object
To create object you must provide `containerId` and `fileName`.
Additionally, you can provide `payload` (base64 encoded data) and `attributes`.

Attribute is key value data that is stored with object. Key and value must be in utf8 format and must not be empty.

Valid attribute:
* `MyAttribute: 'some value'`

Invalid attribute:
* `MyAttribute: ''`

Also, you can use this attribute to further object searching.
